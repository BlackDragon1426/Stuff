The Games Functionality


If you jump at a wall while running in 85-95 degrees your character will scale it Vertically. 

When you jump at a wall 0-85, 95-180 you will scale it horizontally.

If there is a wall that you run up and there is a ledge to grab and will hang there in till the player does something
like push forwards on the left stick "movement stick" or back to drop and left for left and right for right.

If you run/sprint/slide at a wall your character will automatically take cover. 

If your character slides at a mountable object they will automaticall take cover. 

cover is automatic. 

When you look down the sights of your gun when in cover your character will raise his head over
the cover more and more the more you look down over the cover, it is like a seesaw. 

When in cover you will have more options with the "A" button like if you move to the edge and there
is more cover close by it will roll or just move their. "good for stealth"

If you step in water or blood it will leave a trail of foot steps and if you are soaked in one you will be dripping
and is much more notice able.
